# ImageFeatureMatching
This is an assignment I did for my Into to Image Understanding class at UofT.  This code uses a homography to match features of two different images of the same thing.


To ensure this code runs properly, please ensure opencv is installed before running this program - you can
run the following command to do this: pip install opencv-python
